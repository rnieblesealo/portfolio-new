Recently, I accepted an internship offer at Lutron. The journey wasn't easy, but amidst that adversity, I learned a *bunch*. These are some of the most important lessons I learned.

# Why You Suck at Programming (And Why That's OK!)

![ats](/article-assets/table.png) 

**This is what recruiters see when you send in your coveted application.**

It's just a table.

There's your name, some info about you, some links, and that's it. They don't immediately see your portfolio, your LinkedIn profile, or even your resume.

**You're just one more row in what's essentially a giant table.**

Coupled with the hundreds (or even thousands) of applicants that software jobs can get to have at a time, it's pretty easy to feel a bit hopeless. And, to be fair, it's understandable to feel that way.

Tech layoffs, a bad economy, the unpredictable direction of AI, the insane competition... It just seems like everything's against you.

So, what do you do?

###  ⛵️ The First Step...

Is to realize that *you suck.*

Yes, there might be some kids in your class building impressive stuff, looking really smart. Some of them might even have been lucky enough to score big internships. But the reality is that at the early career level, most of us would probably be in the trenches if thrown at a *real* codebase.

Dealing with those takes experience, which is increasingly difficult to come by.

To get to be a great programmer, one must first take a very important first step: *becoming an excellent learner.*

###  🌊 Be Water, My Friend...

Most places don't really expect junior devs/interns to excel at their roles. They might know the road rules of programming, but they haven't been thrown in big city traffic during rush hour yet. For them to become adept in a production environment, they have to get their hands dirty, make some mistakes, and *learn* from them. Eventually, they'll stop sucking and become *hugely* productive.

As a student/early career engineer, don't expect great programming prowess from yourself. It'll take time to get there. But you *can* make the road much smoother, if you *learn how to learn*; to get used to being given a giant pothole of a problem and still be able to shape yourself to fill it just fine.

Like Bruce Lee said: "Be Water, My Friend."

*But how do you do that?*

### 🛠️ Build, build build...

The tried and tested way is to do just what a junior dev does: get your hands dirty! 

Pick an idea you like; it could be anything. Ideally, make it involve something you enjoy. If you like music, build something around that. Skateboards? Throw that in. Videogames? Be my guest. If you enjoy what you're working on, chances are you'll remain more motivated to finish it.

Then, try picking some new tech to build it with. Maybe a stack you're curious for. Never tried Remix? Go for it; if building something low level, why not see what the Rust hype's about? Pick a tool that's appropriate for the job, but also one that's new. Get comfortable with using unfamilar tools to solve unfamiliar problems.

Then, bring your idea to life! On the way there, you'll stumble upon roadblocks that will force you to grow, learn, use your creativity; that's good. Scratching your head means you're doing it right. That's the most important part of building side projects!

Fall in love with solving problems, being creative, learning. In my view, those are the 3 tallest pillars that make a *great* engineer.

### 📔 Document Your Journey!

Recruiters understand that at the early career, candidates will have a lower skill level. They understand that your ability to pick stuff up quickly supersedes your programming prowess. Most candidates that hit the "apply" button suck, just like you! Leverage that.

Proudly show off your process. Build a portfolio, write some blog posts, update others on what you're up to on LinkedIn. *Show the work you're doing*, and the learning that's going on alongside it. Don't forget to add a touch of you! Be authentic, show of how you think. You know you're not *just* one more row in a table; you want others to know that, don't you?

### 🦾 Use AI Wisely...

Yes, AI is disruptive. Yes, it'll probably change software development forever. 

While you're learning, however, it's best to use it as nothing more than a fancy documentation lookup tool. It's a bit like driving a car, once again: you need to know the road rules before you know when it's prudent to break them a bit to get to where you want to get to faster.

Don't allow AI to do any of the building for you unless you have some agency over what it's telling you. Don't forget it's nothing more than a fancy statistical autocorrect; chances are you've backspaced what your phone thinks you want to type more than a few times.

Only when you understand what you're doing is it prudent to let it stick its hand in your code!

### 🤺 Keep Showing Up!

This journey's hard for everyone. If it seems like someone's doing way better than you, it's probably because they started earlier. There's no point in comparing yourself to others; keep showing up for yourself.

Some days, you'll grow a lot.

Some other days, you'll barely move 1%...

But if you get 1% better every single day,

You'll be 18x better in just 6 months...

And 37x better in 1 year.

Keep showing up. Chances are things will begin happening much, much faster than you think.

You've got this! ❤️
